# StarMine Code of Conduct

## Introduction

The StarMine is an innovative Machine Learning-based platform designed to assist in the exploration and evaluation of potential mining sites across celestial bodies. We aim to create a community where all users, contributors, and developers feel respected, valued, and encouraged. Whether you’re contributing code, reporting an issue, or suggesting new features, we expect everyone to adhere to the community standards outlined below.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to maintaining a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for all members of the StarMine project. By participating in this community, you agree to foster a positive, constructive atmosphere and to respect the contributions of others.

## Our Values

1. **Respect and Kindness**
   We expect all members of the community to treat others with kindness and respect. Harassment, discrimination, and offensive language or behavior will not be tolerated. We believe that a community built on respect is essential for fostering collaboration and innovation.

2. **Collaboration and Support**
   The StarMine thrives on collaboration. If you encounter an issue or need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out to others. Likewise, offer your help when you can. Encourage the exchange of ideas, and work together to improve the project.

3. **Constructive Feedback**
   Feedback is an essential part of our community’s growth. When giving or receiving feedback, be respectful and open-minded. Constructive criticism leads to better outcomes and helps improve both the project and the community as a whole.

4. **Inclusivity and Diversity**
   We welcome contributions from individuals of all backgrounds and skill levels. The StarMine is a space for diverse perspectives, and everyone should feel empowered to contribute, learn, and share their ideas without fear of discrimination or exclusion.

5. **Professionalism**
   We expect professionalism in all communications, whether they are issues, pull requests, or direct messages. Be mindful of your tone and ensure that interactions remain respectful and polite at all times.

## Expected Behavior

- Treat everyone with kindness, respect, and empathy.
- Embrace diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Offer and receive constructive feedback with an open mind.
- Focus on improving the project and the community for everyone.

- Disrupting the community or project contributions in any form.
- Threatening, intimidating, or bullying behavior.

## Spammy PR Rules

To ensure high-quality contributions, StarMine has established guidelines to prevent spammy pull requests (PRs):

- PRs must be associated with an open issue. PRs without a corresponding issue may be considered spam.
- Avoid submitting trivial or minor changes unless they significantly improve the project.
- Contributions for events like Hacktoberfest should focus on solving meaningful issues rather than making superficial changes.
- Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the PR being marked as spam after consultation with the contributor.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. Reports will be handled confidentially and with care.

We are committed to addressing all concerns promptly to ensure a safe, inclusive environment for everyone.

## Enforcement

Contributors who violate this Code of Conduct may face actions deemed appropriate by the project leadership. These actions may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project.
